Next js / Typescript 

One month ago, I embarked on a journey to enhance my web development skills. <br> I initiated this endeavor by creating a Netflix clone using React.js and JavaScript, incorporating Firebase for backend functionalities. <br> As I delved deeper into my learning, I felt the need to expand my toolkit and explore new technologies.<br>
<br>
Driven by the desire to embrace modern development practices, I dived into the world of TypeScript and Next.js.<br> With these robust tools at my disposal, I set out to create a Disney+ clone, elevating my projects to the next level of sophistication and maintainability.<br>
<br>
The transition to TypeScript brought a new layer of type safety and clarity to my codebase, allowing for a more seamless development experience.<br> Integrating Next.js empowered me with server-side rendering capabilities and a highly optimized production build.<br>
<br>
Through the process of building the Disney+ clone with Next.js and TypeScript,<br>
I not only honed my skills in these technologies but also gained valuable insights <br> into creating scalable and efficient web applications.<br> This journey has been instrumental in my growth as a developer,<br> equipping me with a versatile skill set that I am eager to apply to future projects.<br>
